##_

###PropertyIndex\n
DISCRETIZATION_METHOD\n
 Discretization method.\n\n

PARTITION_METHOD\n
 Multi-processor partitioning method.\n\n

BOUNDARY_CONDITION\n
 Boundary condition type. See BoundaryIdentify.\n\n

SCATTERING_ORDER\n
 Defines the level of harmonic expansion for the scattering source.Default 1.
 Expects to be followed by an integer.\n\n

SWEEP_EAGER_LIMIT\n
 The eager limit to be used in message size during sweep initialization.
 This expects to be followed by a size in bytes (Max 64,0000).Default 32,000.
 See note below.\n\n

READ_RESTART_DATA\n
 Indicates the reading of restart data from restart file.
 The value can be followed by two
 optional strings. The first is the folder name which can be relative or
 absolute, and the second is the file base name. These are defaulted to
 "YRestart" and "restart" respectively.\n\n

\code
chiLBSSetProperty(phys1,READ_RESTART_DATA,"YRestart1")
\endcode

WRITE_RESTART_DATA\n
 Indicates the writing of restart data to restart files.
 The value can be followed by two optional strings and a number
 optional strings. The first string is the folder name which can be relative or
 absolute, and the second string is the file base name. The number is the time
 interval (in minutes) for a restart write to be triggered (apart from GMRES
 restarts and the conclusion of groupset completions) .These are defaulted to
 "YRestart", "restart" and 30 minutes respectively.\n\n

\code
chiLBSSetProperty(phys1,WRITE_RESTART_DATA,"YRestart1","restart",1)
\endcode

###Discretization methods
 PWLD2D = Piecewise Linear Finite Element 2D.\n
 PWLD3D = Piecewise Linear Finite Element 3D.

###Partitioning methods
 SERIAL = No multi-processing.\n
 FROM_SURFACE = Same partitioning as used on Surface mesh.

###BoundaryIdentify
This value follows the argument BOUNDARY_CONDITION and identifies which
boundary is under consideration. Right now only boundaries aligned with
cartesian axes are considered. Followed by LBSBoundaryType.\n
XMAX = Right boundary \n
XMIN = Left boundary \n
YMAX = Front boundary \n
YMIN = Back boundary \n
ZMAX = Top boundary \n
ZMIN = Bottom boundary \n

###LBSBoundaryType
Specifies the type of boundary. Depending on the type this argument needs
to be followed by one or more values. Note: By default all boundaries are
type VACUUM.\n
\n
LBSBoundaryTypes.VACUUM\n
Specifies a vaccuum boundary condition. It is not followed by any value.\n
\n
\n
LBSBoundaryTypes.INCIDENT_ISOTROPIC\n
Incident isotropic flux. This argument needs to be followed by a lua table
index 1 to G where G is the amount of energy groups. Note internally this
is mapped as 0 to G-1.\n
\n
LBSBoundaryTypes.REFLECTING\n
Reflecting boundary condition. Beware, when opposing reflecting boundary
conditions are used this enduces a cyclic dependency which will increase the
iteration convergence behavior.



###Note on the Eager limit
The eager limit is the message size limit before which non-blocking MPI send
calls will execute without waiting for a matching receive call. The limit is
platform dependent but in general 64 kb. Some systems have 32 kb as a limit
and therefore we use that as a default limit in ChiTech. There is a fine
interplay between message size and the shear amount of messages that will be
sent. In general smaller messages tend to be more efficient, however, when
there are too many small messages being sent around the communication system
on the given platform will start to suffer. One can gain a small amount of
parallel efficiency by lowering this limit, however, there is a point where
the parallel efficiency will actually get worse so use with caution.
